.. _gdal_multidim_cpp:

================================================================================
Entry point for C++ Multi-dimensional Array API
================================================================================

Since GDAL 3.12, :source_file:`gcore/gdal_multidim_cpp.h` is the include file
for all headers related to the C++ Multi-dimensional Array API.

In earlier versions (and still available in the GDAL 3.x series), :file:`gdal_priv.h`
is the equivalent include file.

Note that the C++ API is also used by GDAL internals and may be subject from
time to time to backwards incompatible changes.
